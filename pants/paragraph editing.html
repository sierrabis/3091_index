	<h1>Thoughts on the web</h1>
	<h2>Reading 1: Turing Complete User</h2>
	<h3>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user”?</h3>
		<p>Lialina stresses the importance of separating the term, user, from people, as it diminishes the value, and skill set the  developers work hard to utilize. Their role as a UXD has progressed technology to appear as invisible to the people interacting with the software. All users thoughts need to revolve around are their feelings and getting to their end goal, not having to connect the coding and wires in the hidden background. Lialina's opinion works to be an advocate to protect and preserve the existence of the user and their rights being a creator in this industry.</p>
	<h3>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user?</h3>
		<p>Provide some of the qualities that she outlines. Lialina's uses the terms, "Universal User" "General Purpose User" or the "Turing Complete User" to describe her idea of an ideal internet user. As a user, one should be able to complete their desired task, regardless if the program was designed for that specific outcome. This ideal user could think outside how the program was intended to work and challenge themselves to create their own adaptions with technology.</p>
	<h3>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"?</h3>
		<p>From my own experience interacting with the web there are lots of "gaps" to be filled by the user. Examples could be uploading a video on youtube, all content shared on social media platforms, forums designed to hear opinions of the people, or responding to a ad for purchase. The web is designed for users to interact with each other and add their own invisible coding into the grid. </p>
	<h2>Reading 2: The Poetry of Tools</h2>
	<h3>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h3>
		<p>In today's digital age, we often treat technology as a convenient outlet that satisfies our every need. In order to make great use of technology,  Seu tells us to 'de-familiarize' its use, as a way to better appreciate its capabilities and recognize the hard team work that went into its creations. Viewers have no need to understand the weight and problem solving that went into our seamless use. Thus, as we de-familiarize our routines and habits we will regain the respect and take a deeper look at its benefits. This relates to poetry, which begs us to question its meaning while seeking clarity - similarly, technology can offer us much more once we learn to find it. </p>
	<h3>2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics. Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h3>
		<p>Seu highlights a unique way of interpreting, interacting and analyzes web pages through the taxonomy tool, 'removing function from form'. This approach to a poetic, harmonious, union with web technology allows viewers to dissociate the function of a tool designed to have specific responses, to benefit a purpose of reimagining and associating these assets as an aesthetic experience to enjoy. Repurposing visual functions that have solely been designed to  enhance ones' desired outcome, to useless data, is extremely impactful and combats the intensity and 'restrictions' that have been placed on these tools to create a new space of curiosity, excitement and laughter. This online interface, <a href='http://endless.horse/'>endless.horse</a>, does a really marvellous job at repurposing language we have come to understand by creating the shape of a horse that extends, yet never ends, no matter how long you spend scrolling down. It is simplistic, timeless and very light and pleasant to interact with.</p>
		<p>Another category I'd like to highlight is 'Performing Data'. Humans have evolved with passing down the comprehension of language and data and how we can utilize its power to express new information through unique scopes and perspectives of our own. Data allows us to build on and create sequential comprehension. When merged into the web, we can repurpose this understanding to benefit our approach at sharing this information through reordering of displayed materials of data. A nice website that hits this poetic category well, would be, <a href='http://www.koalastothemax.com/'>koalastothemax.com</a>,  as it allows the user to interact and reorder the set data how they please. The user's interaction becomes the importance to the success of the web page. In order to decode and enjoy the websites information, it is completely up to the users choice to dictate its performance.</p>
	<h2>Reading 3: My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge</h2>
	<h3>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h3>
		<p>Large corporations like google, facebook, instagram and snapchat dominate the social sphere with faceless unpersonalized web fronts. This is extremely problematic as these outputs are placed to gain strength as capitalist, manipulative and profitable forefront. This disconnects the users with their personal freedom to express and explore, constraining and containing their innovative potential. Schwulst mentions, "we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future", ultimately we are just one screen interacting with another and we need to lowers the standards and expectations of what one can and should be added to the world wide web for desired responses. We as artists, creators, imaginators and designers need to take it upon us, as our duty, to bring the internet back to a playscape to explore and grow harmoniously. Individual websites allow complete control and autonomy over ones innovative and conceptualized direction. Laurel Schwulst advocacy for individual creators to take back the web is empowering and extremely prevalent to where the web lays today. Within Schwulst's essay, she expressed the variety of ways a web page can be interpreted and manifested by individuals who acts as both the author and the architect. These large corporations do a strong job at bridging the technical difficulties to connect and share, but we as creatives have to be weary and not allow our imagination to be shaped by these cookie cutter corporations.</p>
	<h3>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison.</h3>	
		<h3> Pants as a metaphor </h3>
		<p> Your favourite jeans fit with perfect form, are extremely comfortable and make you feel confident and sexy in your skin. Through lots of wear they can start to lose their touch and will break down, a natural cycle of life. As well, over time, bodies change, grow, while simultaneously identities shift and taste and judgement alters. In that moment of  purchase, you knew it was a wise transaction of money for pleasure, even though we are aware of our constant state of change and growth. This can easily be related and applied to the existence of a web page. When caught in the <span class='blue'> moment of inspiration and creation </span>you develop a site and release it to be free in the world wide web for your personal satisfaction. As your skills develop and your creativity expands far beyond, you can fathom new and powerful spaces to share. That previous site created can be used as a marking point to highlight your growth and development. Just like when it's time to put those jeans in the back of the closet, you'll be grateful for all the support and <span class='blue'>killer lewks </span>it was able to provide.
